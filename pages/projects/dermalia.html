                    Dermalia is a dermatological products store based in Peru. The solution I developed for them was built using WordPress, one of the most popular CMS platforms. By leveraging plugins, custom PHP, and CSS, I created an e-commerce site complete with a virtual payment gateway and integrated it with an invoicing system provided by an external vendor.

                    Building the Dermalia website was a meticulous process aimed at creating an e-commerce platform that accurately represented the brand's identity and provided a seamless shopping experience for users. The project started with an in-depth understanding of Dermalia's brand, which focuses on delivering high-quality dermatological products. The goal was to reflect this in a clean, professional, and user-friendly website design.

                <p>
                    The development process began with selecting WordPress as the CMS due to its flexibility and robust plugin ecosystem. Customization was key to achieving the desired functionality, so I utilized various plugins to enhance the site’s capabilities, particularly WooCommerce for the e-commerce functionalities. The integration of a virtual payment gateway was a critical aspect, ensuring that transactions were secure and user-friendly.

                    To meet the client’s needs, I also connected the site to a billing system provided by a third-party vendor. This required working with PHP and CSS to customize the plugin functionality and ensure seamless communication between the online store and the billing system. The entire process involved regular consultations with the client to ensure that the solution met their expectations and aligned with the brand’s standards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, the website was thoroughly tested for usability, performance, and security. This ensured that Dermalia's online store was not only functional but also provided a smooth and reliable shopping experience for customers. The end result was a professional e-commerce site that effectively supports Dermalia’s business objectives and enhances its online presence.

                    <b>Note: </b>It's important to note that Dermalia has currently decided to put its e-commerce operations on "standby." As a result, the live production site is not active at the moment. However, a staging environment is still available where you can view the site as it existed before activities were paused.

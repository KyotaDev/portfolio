                    This is my personal web portfolio, where I showcase my work experience, technical skills, and projects. The site is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it features a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes. The site is hosted on GitHub Pages and the source code is available on GitHub.

                    This is the first version of my portfolio, designed to showcase my web development skills. The layout is inspired by How to Web Dev and an earlier portfolio design I had created in Figma. It's hosted on Hostinger and GitHub, where the code is openly available.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The portfolio features a multilingual interface (Spanish, English, and Japanese) and presents my initial projects, with plans to include more sophisticated work that addresses real-world challenges. While this is an early iteration, I am continually refining both the design and the code to better reflect my evolving skills and professional growth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project not only demonstrates my technical abilities but also my commitment to continuous improvement, as I progressively enhance both the aesthetic and functional aspects of the portfolio. Stay tuned for updates as I add new projects and features!
